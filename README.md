# SuperResolutionWithRDN

 In this project, Residual Dense Networks will be used to tackle the problem of SISR. This architecture makes full use of hierarchial features from original low-resolution (LR) images to achieve higher performance. The network structure will consists of four main blocks. The core of the architecture is the residual dense block(RDB) where the local features are extracted and made use of via dense convolutional layers. In this work, investigation of each block was performed and effect of each modules was be studied and analyzed. Analyses by use various loss metric was also carried out in this project. Also a comparison was made with various state of the art models.The modules in the model were be built from scratch and were trained and tested. The training and testing was be carried out for various scaling factors and the performance was be evaluated.
